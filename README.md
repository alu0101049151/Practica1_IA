# SEARCH ALGORITHM: A * search algorithm.
### By Basilio GÃ³mez Navarro.

## 	Goal:

 - Propose, implement and evaluate A * searches to find the minimum path 
   between two vertices of a graph.

## Repository Structure:

 - Src: Contains .h and .cpp files of the program and Makefile.
 - Inputs: Contains the input files for test the program.


### Inputs:

 - Graph 1:
    Number of nodes: 15
    Origin point: 1
    Destination point: 8

 - Graph 2:
    Number of nodes: 15
    Origin point: 2
    Destination point: 14

 - Graph 3:
    Number of nodes: 20
    Origin point: 1
    Destination point: 15

 - Graph 4:
    Number of nodes: 20
    Origin point: 10
    Destination point: 18

 - Graph 5:
    Number of nodes: 20
    Origin point: 1
    Destination point: 2
